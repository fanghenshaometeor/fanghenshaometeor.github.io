I am a Postdoc Fellow at [ASTAPLE](https://www.astaple.com/) working with [Prof. Haibo HU](https://haibohu.org/) in [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/?sc_lang=en) of [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/).

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in March 2024 under the supervision of [Prof. Jie YANG](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tmx7tu8AAAAJ&hl=en) at [Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/) in [Department of Automation](https://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). Before that, I received the BA.Eng. degree in [College of Electronic and Information Engineering](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/) from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in 2018. I then received the MA.Eng. degree in [Department of Automation](https://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021.


Research interests

My research interests focus on **trustworthy deep learning**. Currently, my works are about the **robustness** of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against those *pixel-perturbed* or *distribution-shifted* inputs, within the fields of **adversarial learning** and **out-of-distribution detection**.

- DNNs trained on clean images show terrible generalization performance on those carefully-designed invisible perturbed images, *i.e.*, *adversarial examples*, which has raised widespread attention on the *adversarial robustness* of DNNs.
- DNNs cannot generalize well on data that differs from the training distribution, *i.e.*, *In-Distribution (InD)*. In this regard, it remains a valuable task of detecting whether new samples are from the InD or OoD (Out-of-Distribution) of DNNs in the inference stage.

In addition, I have previously dabbled in **kernel methods** in machine learning.
